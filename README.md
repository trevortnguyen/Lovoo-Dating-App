# Introduction
Dating is already a difficult space to navigate, and doing it online makes it even harder. How can you make your dating profile stand out from others so you can find your perfect match?

## Which components of a user’s dating profile make their profile more popular?
Regression analysis will be performed and the Lovoo dataset will be used to answer the question. Lovoo is a European dating app based in Dresden, Germany, and it is the largest German-speaking dating app — specifically in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria — in terms of downloads. The dataset on Lovoo v3 Dating App User Profiles and Statistics, the third version and iOS version of the app, was found on Kaggle and was initially published on Data World (<a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/lovoo-v3-dating-app-user-profiles-and-statistics">`data source`</a>). The dataset contains 4 individual data files collected from the API and User Instances; 2 of the data files are from the API instances and the other 2 data files are from the User Instances. Furthermore, the data files from the API and User Instances each come from 2 sources: a CSV and a database.
